# ABOUT ME
Hello!!! You can call me jumbledFox. I program in Rust, Python, and C++, as well as the occasional website overhaul.
I'm only recently learning Rust after a good few years of C++, getting used to it is going to take some time!
My favourite bands are The Police, Genesis, Supertramp Oingo Boingo, The Alan Parsons Project, and Pink Floyd!!!
I love Half-Life, CS:GO, and Portal, they're some of my favourite games and huge inspirations in my projects :3
I've been having cold showers for <span id=\"coldshowers\">---</span> days now!

# ABOUT THIS WEBSITE
This website was generated with my static website generator <a href=\"https://github.com/jumbledFox/Sting\">Sting</a>, named after Sting of 'The Police' fame.
I designed it myself, it uses the css mix-blend-mode multiply to make anything the background image, which I think looks really nice!!
